Description: A comprehensive R package for analyzing spatial organization patterns 
    in tissues using spatial transcriptomics data. Provides flexible, user-parameterized 
    framework for quantifying spatial coherence, classifying tissue organization, 
    and analyzing treatment effects on tissue architecture. Compatible with Visium, 
    Slide-seq, MERFISH, and other spatial transcriptomics platforms. Based on 
    methodology adapted from Tirosh et al. (Nature, 2016).
